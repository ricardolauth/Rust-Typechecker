# Rust-Typechecker
## Comparison between Haskell and Rust
Haskell's expression syntax makes it perfect for this kind of use case. 
This results in an easy to read and short solution to this problem. In Rust 
there is a bit more "boilerplate" for defining a suitable enum, but moreover 
Rust's enums are very powerful, which also results in a readable and short solution. 
I think most people get faster in Rust because they are likely familiar with other imperative programming languages.
