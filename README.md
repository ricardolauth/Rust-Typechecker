# Rust-Typechecker
## Comparison between Haskell and Rust
Haskell's expression syntax makes it perfect for this kind of use case. 
This results in an easy to read and short solution to this problem. Rust 
has a bit more "boilerplate" for defining an appropriate enum, but in addition 
Rust's enums are very powerful, which also results in a readable and short solution. Rust's enum match expression combined with a simple control flow statement is well suited to this problem. Rust brings the best of the imperative world to a memory-safe option.
I think most people get faster in Rust because they are probably familiar with other imperative programming languages.
